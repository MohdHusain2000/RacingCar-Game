## Description of the project

### Simple Car Racing Game with Source Code is a project that is a single-player game where goal is to race your way and gain more score. The game has a simple design that contains an image sprites and background color. The purpose of the game is to provide fun time with your friends, family, classmate, etc. The Simple Car Racing Game was created in a HTML web browser that use JavaScript engine that enhance the capability of the modern web development. The game is playable through web browser that visualize the car and road.

## Initial Design Features and expectations 

  - ### Movement
    ### The core fundamental foundation of any racing game UI design is based upon the plotted movement system used in the game.The great racing games comprise this system to give players full ownership of the movement. The movement was completed as it can be ilustrated through playing the game.

  - ### Obstacles 
    ### Almost every racing game entails hurdles and obstacles, contributing to the game’s complexity and overall thrill. Obstacles are crucial as they keep the players interested in the game. Furthermore, overcoming such hurdles gives the players a sense of achievement which is instrumental in maintaining enticement. The adventurous random obstacles include barriers, broken roads, bridges, off-roading, street light poles, traffic signals, houses, police cars, and hectic traffic. However during the project only normal cars were used due to the difficulty of developing the game.
   
  - ### Environment
    ### The most pleasing environment may create a legitimate and intimate attachment to a game. For example, a roaring audience, flags waving in the grandstand, confetti being thrown into the racetrack, and fireworks going off all contribute tremendously to the sense that the race is genuinely essential. Winning a race should be fun; it’s the crux of racing. Unfortunetly, The time was not suffiecient to implement such features. 

## Algorithms
   - ### In the intro screen, there will be three buttons named START, QUIT, and INSTRUCTION.
   - ### The player can play the game via keyboard bindings(Left Arrow Key to Move Left, Right Arrow Key to Move Right, Up Arrow Key to Move Upward, Down Arrow Key to Move Downward). 
   - ### The game is so simple you just avoid your card getting collide. The longer you stay in the road your score will  continue to increase.

   ### Generally, the game focuses on designing a AI player which drive a racing car while implementic logic that allow the race to start on specific created environment and then the scoring system will calculate the number of loops to check if the player win or lost the game. During the loops there are other cars and objects that will add difficulties to the games.
